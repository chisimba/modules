MODULE_ID: webservices
MODULE_NAME: webservices
MODULE_DESCRIPTION: Webservices module for generating WSDL and SOAP Services. Both server and client services are catered for. This is a support module for the Chisimba framework, and requires no user input. The W3C defines a Web service as a software system designed to support interoperable machine-to-machine interaction over a network. This definition encompasses many different systems, but in common usage the term refers to those services that use SOAP-formatted XML envelopes and have their interfaces described by WSDL. For example, WS-I only recognizes Web services in the context of these specifications.
