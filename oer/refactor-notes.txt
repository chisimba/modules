  groupedit_class_inc.php
  dbgroups_class_inc.php

NEW FILES
  block_groupedit_class_inc.php
  groupedit_class_inc.php

NEW LAYOUT POSSIBILITIES
  Added <div class='formwrapper'></div> around forms

NOTES:
  The groups functionality has to be the most convoluted code
  I have ever seen. There is no use of proper validation, and
  no use of JS/Ajax to validate fields. Functionality is in the
  controller, but in other methods that do not have a corresponding
  action. There is a lot of work needed to refactor this code. I
  am doing it as follows:

  1. Get the empty form working with minimum other functionality
  2. Add validations and checks
  3. Add edit / add functionality
