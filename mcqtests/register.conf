MODULE_ID: mcqtests
MODULE_NAME: MCQ Tests
MODULE_DESCRIPTION: The multiple choice question test module. It allows lecturers to set up MCQ tests for students who are in their courses. It can be used both as a formative- or summative assessment tool. The tests can also be set to close after a certain time has elapsed. The questions and answers can be set to scrambled. This means that no two students will get a test with the questions and the answers in the same order. The MCQ module also has the functionality to lock the test to specific computer lab by using the IP Addresses of the computers in the lab. The lecturers can also export the results of MCQ test. These results are then emailed to the lecturer via the Internal Email module.
