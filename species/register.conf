TEXT: mod_species_findsounds|Look for sounds|Do you want SPECIES to look for sound clips on the Encyclopedia of Life? If your speices list contains birds, or mammals, it makes sense to look for sound bytes, but if the list contains species, it makes sense to set this parameter to FALSE.
CONFIG: species_userlist|1|mod_species_userlist
TEXT: mod_species_userlist|List of users to search for bird images|A comma delimited list of users (as user IDs) to search for species images. Users must save images in species/genus_species/ in their default file directory. You can find your user ID by going to My profile on the User menu.

TEXT: mod_species_eolnosound|EOL has no sound|The Encyclopedia of Life (EOL) has no sound file for [-species-]. If you know of a freely accessible sound recording for this species, you can join EOL and provide a link to the sound file. If you have access to this species, you could record it and donate the recording to EOL.
TEXT: mod_species_eolnoimg|EOL has no images|The Encyclopedia of Life (EOL) has no image files for [-species-]. You can join EOL and provide a link to a public image file, or you can add CC licensed images to the Encyclopedia of Life group on Flickr.  If you have access to this species, you could photograph it and donate the image to EOL, either directly or via its Flickr group.

TEXT: mod_species_overview|Overview block contents|This is an experiment. It is an attempt to create automatically generated guidebooks for living organisms based on a simple list of species for a group and region of the world. It defaults to Birds of South Africa, but you can scroll down and on the  right you can change it to mammals of South Africa, or check a simple demo if it using plants. Unfortunately, most biologists only share their data via specific websites, so you have to be human to access it. It is time to change this 20th Century mindset, and share data for access whether it is by a human or not.
TEXT: mod_species_overviewuse|How to use it|To use this module, click the letter corresponding to the Group Common Name (e.g. b for barbets) and then click the species you want to see (the letter A is shown by default). Alternatively, click the group (e.g. Batis) to get a quick pictoral guide to that group, then click the species you want to see in more detail. At the bottom right, click another set of organisms to switch from SA Birds to (say) mammals of SA. The plants:proteaceae is just a test at this stage, but birds and mammals are complete.
