MODULE_ID: beautifier
MODULE_NAME: Module Beautifier
MODULE_DESCRIPTION: This module re-formats code of other modules according to PEAR specifications to ensure consistency with framework coding standards. The coding standards that are used, guarantee a consistent look and feel within the code of the entire application. All Chisimba modules should stick to a single style of code, this makes it possible for many different people, from many different backgrounds to all work consistently and easily on a single piece of code. This ensures that the code is infinitely more maintainable for every one working on it, and makes sure that turnaround times for modules and improvements are much quicker, resulting in a superior product all round. This module is specifically a developer tool, and should only be used in a development environment.
