TEXT: help_computerscience_about|help text|This interface will enable you to update your AIML document with new Categories. A pattern is usually in the form of a potential question that a user may ask the bot. It is an UPPERCASE string of characters/words. A reduction is a pattern that may REFER to another pattern, for instance WHAT IS YOUR NAME may refer to WHAT'S YOUR NAME. The template is the potential text that will be returned to the user on execution of the pattern (the answer to the question). Remember, that you may also use Wildcard Characters like * in your pattern definitions for broader patterns.
