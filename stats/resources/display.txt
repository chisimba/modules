This section is for practicing tutorials. How does it work?<BR>
<BR>

The online tutorials consist of sixteen tests based on different sections of the syllabus. <P>
When ou have  finished writing a tutorial, you  immediately will get  your  mark for the specific tutorial you have completed. The mark will be  saved to a database on the server. You may complete the same tutorial more than once to improve your mark.  All attempts will be saved and your time will be recorded.
