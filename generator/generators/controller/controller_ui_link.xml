<title>Build a controller</title>
<description>Build a controller for the Chisimba MVC architecture. The controller is 
named controller.php and resides in the base directory of your module. The class name
of the controller is the same as the directory in which your module is located, which
must also be the same as the module code that identifies your module.</description>
