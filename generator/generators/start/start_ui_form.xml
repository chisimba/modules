<description>The Chisimba code Generator generates code for a Chisimba module. It is still 
under active development. Then there are 2 or more XML files that you need to place in the
generators/OBJECTTYPE directory of the generator module. Thats all you need, the generator
itself takes care of the rest, including generating some of its own interface.

The two required files are OBJECTTYPE_ui_form.xml and OBJECTTYPE_ui_link.xml. The first of 
these contain XML renditions of the input form that you require. The format of this is pretty 
simple, you can look at any of the examples in generators (e.g. controller, register, dbtable, 
edit). The second one contains XML to provide a title and description for the interface.

For almost all uses, you need the skeleton and other XML templates described previously. See 
the examples provided to see how these are structured. What is in them depends on what you 
put in your genOBJECTTYPE class.</description>
