<title>Build a model (dbtable) class</title>
<description>Build a model class derived from a database table for the Chisimba MVC
architecture. The dbtable class is named based on the table name, typically db$table
and resides in the classes directory of your module. Model classes extend the dbtable 
framework class and inherit its methods.</description>
