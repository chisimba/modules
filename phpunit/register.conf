MODULE_ID: phpunit
MODULE_NAME: PHPUnit Test Case Builder
MODULE_DESCRIPTION: Generates PHP test case classes for any module. It implements a code pattern analyser that classifies code into logical groups like Data Management, Utility, Callback and Display methods. These code groupings are then transfered to a single interface class divided into the logical asscociations. This class is then served as input to phpunit and generates a skeleton with all the standard assertions added. This provides a solid base for the developer to start unit testing from as the last step would be to peruse the skeleton and logically select the proper assertions to use. The benefits of having logically inclined test cases include the ability to make core changes and see the rippling effects, identify possible problematic areas (e.g. fields as arguments in insert/edit that do not match up to database field names), identify optimization targets and improve overall integrity of your module.
