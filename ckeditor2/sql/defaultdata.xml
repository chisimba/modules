            Building a new module is as simple as filling in the module
            creation form. You can choose form two different kinds of
            display methods: JSON templates, and dynamic canvas. JSON templates
            are for static modules, with a lot of different interfaces, and
            where the user or administrator is not expected to customize the
            interface. Dynamic canvas invokes the 'Turn editing on...'
            functionality, and can be of three kinds: user-level, module-level,
            or page-level. You cannot mix these three kinds of dynamic canvas.
