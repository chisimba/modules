/**
 *
 * Execute shell scripts
 *
 * This module provides a helper class to execute shell scripts stored in /var/chisimba/scripts/
 * as well as a user interface for the system administrator to execute administrative scripts
 * from a web browser.
 *
 * Note: When safe mode is enabled, you can only execute executables within the safe_mode_exec_dir,
 * so this dir must e set to /var/chisimba/scripts or the config param COMMANDEXEC_SCRIPTDIR changed
 * to correspond to the safe_mode_exec_dir. For practical reasons it is currently not allowed to
 * have .. components in the path to the executable in accordance to PHP exec() requirements.
