MODULE_NAME: Wiki
MODULE_DESCRIPTION: A wiki is a website that allows visitors to add, remove, and edit content. This ease of interaction and operation makes a wiki an effective tool for mass collaborative authoring.  A wiki enables documents to be written collaboratively, in a simple markup language using a web browser. A single page in a wiki is referred to as a "wiki page", while the entire body of pages, which are usually highly interconnected via hyperlinks, is "the wiki". A wiki is essentially a database for creating, browsing and searching information.

TEXT: help_wiki_title_view_page|title for wiki help page|Viewing Pages
TEXT: help_wiki_overview_view_page|overview for wiki help page|A wiki invites all users to edit any page or to create new pages within the wiki Web site. A wiki is not a carefully crafted site for casual visitors, instead it seeks to involve the visitor in an ongoing process of creation and collaboration that constantly changes the Web site landscape. The wiki navigation can be found in the left hand column. Users can also search the wiki using the search box below the navigation. The tabs on the page view allow the user to read the artcile, edit it, view its history or discuss it. Wiki pages can also be ranked from very bad to very good using the voting system.

TEXT: help_wiki_title_add_wiki|title for wiki help page|Adding a Wiki
TEXT: help_wiki_overview_add_wiki|overview for wiki help page|This page is used to create your own personal wiki. Enter any Name for the Wiki in the box, but make sure that it is short, preferably 2-3 words. The reason for this recommendation is that it will be selected from a drop-down menu, and  long names are not visible on some web browsers when they are on a drop-down menu. Add a description for your personal wiki, something which captures the essence of what your wiki is about. Select whether you want your wiki to be public, open or private by clicking on either one of the radio buttons. A public wiki is open to anonymous visitors to the site, an open wiki is only available to users who are logged in, a private wiki can only be viewed by the user who created it. The latter is useful if you want to use the wiki to create a private journal, or drafts of assignments, for example. Once you are happy with what you have entered, click the "Create Wiki" button, and your personal wiki is created.
