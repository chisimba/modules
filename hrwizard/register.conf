MODULE_ID: hrwizard
MODULE_NAME: HR Mail wizard
MODULE_DESCRIPTION: The HR Wizard is a simple form based module that enables the distribution of IRP 5 forms to employees of an organization. A zip archive of PDF documents is uploaded via a simple web interface, as well as a comma separated values file of staff numbers and email addresses. The CSV file is parsed, and the relevant PDF is attached to an email message that is then sent to all employees. Once the mail drop is completed, the system will delete the PDF files from the server for security reasons. This is a highly specialized module, and should only be used in an HR scenario.
