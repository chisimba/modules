MODULE_ID: httpclient
MODULE_NAME: httpclient
MODULE_DESCRIPTION: HTTP client module. This is a support module for the Chisimba framework, and requires no user input. It is often neccessary to create connections with remote web sites or services, and this module provides that functionality. Developers are able to create connections to remote web sites within their module code, and provide the content within their own module to the user with very little effort. This module requires no additional PHP extensions, and can be substituted for extensions that require re-compiling of PHP in shared hosting environments where other tools for grokking URL's are not available. HTTP Client can be used in conjunction with the webservices, feeds and many other modules to provide rich functionality to other modules.
