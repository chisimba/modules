To quickly see how the module works:

1. Install it.
2. Go to resources/tmp.
3. In there are some sql files. Run them in MySql. (Sample notes will be
inserted into your tables). 

You can quickly get a look at how mynotes modules functions. 

There will be a tag cloud on the left and a couple of notes on the right with 
paging. The latest two notes will show at the top with html stripped and with 
words count less than 200. These notes will then be followed by a list of notes
that show only titles of the note.
