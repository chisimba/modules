MODULE_NAME: GeoRSS
MODULE_DESCRIPTION: GeoRSS is an emerging standard for encoding location as part of an RSS feed. (RSS is an XML format used to describe feeds ("channels") of content, such as news articles, MP3 play lists, and blog entries. These RSS feeds are rendered by programs such as aggregators and web browsers). In GeoRSS, location content consists of geographical points, lines, and polygons of interest and related feature descriptions. GeoRSS feeds are designed to be consumed by geographic software such as map generators. By building these encodings on a common information model, the GeoRSS collaboration hopes to promote interoperability and "upwards-compatibility" across encodings. At this point, the GeoRSS collaboration has completed work on two primary encodings which they call GeoRSS GML and GeoRSS Simple. GeoRSS GML is a formal OGC GML Application Profile, and supports a greater range of features than Simple, notably coordinate reference systems other than WGS84 latitude/longitude. There is also a W3C geo GeoRSS serialization, which is older and partly depraced but still most widely used. GeoRSS can be used to extend both RSS 1.0 and 2.0, as well as Atom, the IETF's latest standard for feeds.
