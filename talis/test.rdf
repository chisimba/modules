It can be very very rewarding to adopt a stray cat. Cats become stray for all sorts of
reasons but often they have lost their original owner or have been driven away through
cruelty. Before you can adopt a stray cat you must win its trust. If you regularly feed it
and don't approach it too soon it may learn that you mean it no harm. Persevere, gradually
gaining its confidence until you can finally touch it and even call it over for its food.
