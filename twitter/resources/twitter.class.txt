I have written a complete code library for twitter using PHP for an upcoming project I will be releasing soon.
Get the code here twitterPHP.

Methods
update($status)
publicTimeline($sinceid=false)
friendsTimeline($id=false,$since=false)
userTimeline($id=false,$count=20,$since=false)
showStatus($id)
friends($id=false)
followers()
featured()
showUser($id)
directMessages($since=false)
sendDirectMessage($user,$text)

Examples

Get the Public Timeline

$t= new twitter();
$res = $t->publicTimeline();
if($res===false){
   echo "ERROR<hr/>";
   echo "<pre>";
   print_r($t->responseInfo);
   echo "</pre>";
}else{
   echo "SUCCESS<hr/>";
   echo "<pre>";
   print_r($res);
   echo "</pre>";
}

Update your status (change username and password of course)

$t= new twitter();
$t->username='username';
$t->password='password';
$res = $t->update('i am testing twitter.class.php');
if($res===false){
   echo "ERROR<hr/>";
   echo "<pre>";
   print_r($t->responseInfo);
   echo "</pre>";
}else{
   echo "SUCCESS<hr/>Status Posted";
}

Let me know what you think or if you find this useful.

      nice but not usable for php4, perhaps its better not to provide an object in php5 and an xml file in php4.
      create an array to use in both php versions.

      PHP XML Parser for Twitter…

      Mich hat es mal wieder gereizt etwas PHP zu programmieren. Aus diesem Grund wollt ich mal versuchen ein Serendipity Plugin zu schreiben. Naheliegend für mich war und ist ein Twitter Sidebar Plugin und die ersten Erfolge sind schon zu verzeichnen David…

      so I addes a new feature to the class of david, its not completed yet but already works for some twitter features.
      now you are able to get the xml response as a array - and now you can work with this class in an easy way using php4.

      blogged it here and try to get in contact with david

      Why didn’t you documented it in PhpDoc (or similar) format ? Don’t be lazy, it’s easy!

      Good luck for the project.

      […] easy to use class wrappers for the APIs it was a piece of cake. I used easy scrobbler, phpFlickr, this Twitter library (with some cURL modifications so it’d run on Dreamhost) and SimplePie for the other RSS […]

      this is excellent code mate, well done. Its above my level of php atm, but not for long :p thanks for proverbially flicking my brain into action again.
