README
------

This module will house HTML5 elements (components). It is still very much a work in progress, and should be used only by those with at least a cursory knowledge of how to do HTML5 with a decent fallback to JS or Flash in some cases to render correctly on all browsers.

Please add one element per class to the classes directory.

If you need to make use of resources, please include them

Please make sure any dependencies are noted in the register.conf file!
