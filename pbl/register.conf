MODULE_ID: pbl
MODULE_NAME: Problem Based Learning
MODULE_DESCRIPTION: Problem-based learning (PBL) is based on the idea that a group of [-readonlys-] can use a given case or problem to formulate their own learning objectives. The individuals prior knowledge should be used to help understand the case and allow the group members to learn from each other. The learning objectives or learning issues are used to drive the individuals study outside of the classroom. The online PBL is a virtual classroom in which [-readonlys-] can interact, it displays the case and provides a real-time chat area.

COMMENT: PBL Introduction
TEXT: mod_pbl_paraIntro||Problem-based learning (PBL) has recently been introduced into the curricula of many universities and medical schools throughout the world. It is an active way of learning in which [-readonlys-] are initially presented with a problem. Then, it is the realization of what they know and don't know about the problem that drives the learning process.
TEXT: mod_pbl_paraSetting||In the PBL setting, [-readonlys-] are usually divided into small groups and presented with the problem in a progressive way. This method demands, and at the same time has the potential to develop, problem solving skills and learner independence. These are some of its advantages over the traditional curriculum.
TEXT: mod_pbl_paraRole||The teacher plays the role of a facilitator and in this regard his or her skills in leading and understanding the process are very important for the method to succeed.
TEXT: mod_pbl_paraAim||The aim of this project is to implement PBL in a virtual Web environment, by creating novel tools to simulate, in a client-server model, the role of a human facilitator and a real tutorial room.
TEXT: mod_pbl_paraServer||The server side will provide the backbone and capabilities for the available features to work properly, ie, for broadcasting the messages to all users, like in a chat room, parsing .pbl files and providing information to the [-readonlys-] (including images, video, sound, and any other media-rich content), preserving session information, among other things.
TEXT: mod_pbl_paraXML||The cases or problems are provided by the .pbl files mentioned above, which are basically XML files. PBL-OL or PBL Online, will be complemented by authoring tools to help Tutors create their problems in a painless way.
TEXT: mod_pbl_paraCIL||This is one in a few Technologies to be developed as part of
TEXT: mod_pbl_paraInProgress||This is work in progress and so it is subject to continuous change and improvement, but if you want you can have a look at some still very primitive demos. Please note, the name and scenario described in our medical cases are fictitious. Any similarity with a real person is pure coincidence.

TEXT: help_pbl_about|About Problem Based Learning|Problem-based learning (PBL) is based on the idea that a group of [-readonlys-] can use a given case or problem to formulate their own learning objectives. The individuals prior knowledge should be used to help understand the case and allow the group members to learn from each other. The learning objectives or learning issues are used to drive the individuals study outside of the classroom. The online PBL is a virtual classroom in which [-readonlys-] around the country or world can interact. The classroom displays the case and provides a real-time chat area in which the group can interact.

TEXT: help_pbl_overview_classroom|Help for interacting in a PBL classroom|The case information or problem is displayed to all group members. The current scene is displayed for discussion. Use the virtual facilitator to progress through the case. Some of the scenes in the case contain tasks that must be solved before moving on to the next scene in the case. A private notebook is provided for taking online notes on the case. The learning issues and hypothesis derived from the case are written up by the scribe in the tabbed boxes provided on the upper right side of the page. The scribe is the only member of the group with permission to write, save and erase the learning issues and hypotheses. The learning issues of the other group members are updated after the scribe has modified them. Interaction with the virtual facilitator occurs by placing a . (dot) before the text entered in the chat box. The chair is the only person with permission to access the virtual facilitator. If the [-author-] has not assigned a chair then a group member can be nominated as the chair. This is done using the virtual facilitator. A scribe can also be assigned if one has not already been assigned. The following commands for the virtual facilitator are available, (.help) refers the [-readonly-] to the help icon; (.more info) provides the [-readonly-] with the next section of the case; (.chair username) is used to assign a person the position of chair; (.scribe username) is used to assign the scibe position. Group interaction and discussion takes place using the real-time chat. A log of the chat is kept and can be viewed by clicking on the icon below 'View PBL log'. The chat from the previous session can be restored to the live chat by clicking on the link 'Restore chat from previous session'. Click on the 'Exit' button on the upper left of the page to leave the classroom.
