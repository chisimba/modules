MODULE_DESCRIPTION: A wiki is a website that allows visitors to add, remove, and edit content. This ease of interaction and operation makes a wiki an effective tool for mass collaborative authoring.  A wiki enables documents to be written collaboratively, in a simple markup language using a web browser. A single page in a wiki is referred to as a "wiki page", while the entire body of pages, which are usually highly interconnected via hyperlinks, is "the wiki". A wiki is essentially a database for creating, browsing and searching information.
