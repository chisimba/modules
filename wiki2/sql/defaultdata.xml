+++ What is a wiki
* A wiki is a website that allows visitors to add, remove, and edit content.
* This ease of interaction and operation makes a wiki an effective tool for mass collaborative authoring.

+++ Characteristics
* A wiki enables documents to be written collaboratively, in a simple markup language using a web browser. A single page in a wiki is referred to as a "wiki page", while the entire body of pages, which are usually highly interconnected via hyperlinks, is "the wiki". A wiki is essentially a database for creating, browsing and searching information.
* A defining characteristic of wiki technology is the ease with which pages can be created and updated. Generally, there is no review before modifications are accepted.

+++ Pages and editing
* The source format, sometimes known as "wikitext'", is augmented with a simplified markup language to indicate various structural and visual conventions. An often used example of one such convention is to start a line of text with an asterisk ("*") in order to mark it as an item in a bulleted list.

+++ Linking and creating pages
* Wikis are a hypertext medium, with non-linear navigational structures. Each page typically contains a large number of links to other pages. Hierarchical navigation pages often exist in larger wikis, often a consequence of the original page creation process, but they do not have to be used. Links are created using a specific syntax, the so-called "link pattern".
* !CamelCase-based wikis are instantly recognizable because they have many links with names such as "!TableOfContents" and "!BeginnerQuestions".

+++ Searching
* Most wikis offer at least a title search, and sometimes a full-text search.

+++ Controlling changes
* History comparison reports highlight the changes between two revisions of a page. Wikis are generally designed with the philosophy of making it easy to correct mistakes, rather than making it difficult to make them. Thus, while wikis are very open, they provide a means to verify the validity of recent additions to the body of pages. The most prominent, on almost every wiki, is the "Recent Changes" page. A specific list numbering recent edits, or a list of all the edits made within a given time frame.
