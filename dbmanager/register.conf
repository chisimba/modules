MODULE_ID: dbmanager
MODULE_NAME: dbmanager
MODULE_DESCRIPTION: Database management demonstration module. This is a module that demonstrates the use of the database management tools that are available in the Chisimba framework. There are tools for creating and dropping databases, as well as manipulating tables and column names. There is also support for database schema manipulation, in order to back up and move your database data and structure to a different database. It also forms the basis of the improved Active Dynamic Mirroring (ADM) system in Chisimba. Most of the functionality contained within this module should be used programmatically through other modules, and so can be considered a development tool.
