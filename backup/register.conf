TEXT: mod_backup_backuppath|Full file system path to place backups|Full file system path to place backups (e.g. /var/www/backups/). IMPORTANT - be sure to include the leading and trailing / characters. Note that it is best to place backups outside your site, otherwise you my end up with recursively larger files as you backup your previous backups. Please note that you must create this path manually, and chown it to www-data:www-data (or the appropriate webserver user depending on your system).
